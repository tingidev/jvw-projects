# Personal projects

This repository holds the content for all my personal projects. In general each folder is a stand-alone project, with an iPython notebook for primary execution. Any supported data and created images are found in the relevant subfolders.

The projects are fully documented on my personal website, so please start here: http://joerivanwijngaarden.com

### Prerequisites

Each project runs on the Anaconda Distribution with python 3.6. The first cell in each notebook will show which specific packages are required, and should be installed and loaded to run the code.
